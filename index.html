            <p class="b_left">I’ve been to the Geneva Motor Show half a dozen times, and I can confidently say that the new Mac Pro looks tailor-made for that exhibition of exotics. It’s got a huge and imposing metal grille up front and tons of speed and power on the inside. It’s built with bespoke components, performance-optimized aerodynamics, and a starting price that means most of us will only ever get to look at, never own, one. And even though we’ve never seen it before, it’s instantly recognizable as an expensive, glamorous powerhouse machine. Yes, Apple’s 2019 Mac Pro is the supercar of the computer world.</p><img src="img/items/2.jpg">
            <p class="col_2">Like the latest debut from Lamborghini or McLaren, this Mac Pro has an immediate visual impact, looking at once familiar and enticingly novel and different. It carries on a family lineage — from the original Mac Pro, pretending the 2013 “trash can” never happened — expressed in the pair of steel handles and the latticed front and rear. Apple’s famously meticulous attention to detail is expressed in the curves and forms of this Mac Pro chassis, and it’s the little touches that make the design intriguing and memorable. There are no corners to the aluminum sheath, for instance, which slides on and off with apparent ease.</p><img src="img/items/3.jpg">
            <p class="b_left">Those little touches are helped by Apple’s outsize budget, of course, as few PC makers would indulge in having dual-layered, precision-cut aluminum frames just to create the hypnotic effect of the new grille. All designers aim to create iconic looks, but those become a high priority with supercars, and I’d argue they’ve long been a priority with Apple’s design chief Jony Ive, for better (the MacBook Pro and Air of yesteryear) or worse (the silly charging method for the Apple Pencil). Nobody buys a Ferrari just for the way it drives, and even if you have purely functional reasons to get this new Mac Pro, you’ll still feel more satisfied with it just because of how it looks. This is a class of glamorous performance machines where looks matter.</p>
